# CNEP
CNEP (Contrastive Notes Events Pretraining), Contrastive Learning with Clinical Notes and Events Data
Pretraining from MIMIC-III.

## What is CNEP?
CNEP is a descendant of CLIP, the OpenAI model, and it operates on multimodal data, the same as CLIP, but on text and
event data rather than images and text.
Otherwise, CNEP differs mainly in the encoders used and, of course, in the training data.
